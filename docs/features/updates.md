# Updates

Rolo checks GitHub Releases once a day, offers the newest release for its own channel in a native
window with its release notes, installs it and relaunches. There is no Sparkle and no appcast: the
release feed the website already reads is the feed the app reads.

## Invariants

- **Rolo installs its own updates, and Homebrew stays out of the way.** The cask must declare
  `auto_updates true`, which is Homebrew's own flag for an app that manages its own version. `brew
  update && brew upgrade` therefore skips Rolo entirely — it is never reported outdated, never
  re-downloaded, and a self-updated copy is never trashed or rolled back. `brew install`, `brew
  uninstall` and `brew list` keep working unchanged.
- **The archive is a zip, never the DMG.** A zip expands with `ditto`; a DMG would have to be mounted,
  which means a volume, a Spotlight handle and a detach that can fail. A release published without a
  zip is not installable and is not offered.
- **Nobody ever runs `xattr`.** An archive Rolo fetched itself is not quarantined — macOS sets
  that flag for sandboxed downloaders and for apps that opt in with `LSFileQuarantineEnabled`, and
  Rolo is neither. `Quarantine` checks anyway through `getxattr`/`removexattr` rather than the
  `xattr` tool, and an app that still carries the flag is refused rather than installed.
- **A matching signing identity is the only integrity guarantee.** Rolo is self-signed and never
  notarized, so a downloaded bundle is trusted when its seal validates *and* its leaf certificate is
  byte-identical to the running app's. That same match is what preserves the Accessibility (TCC)
  grant across the swap, so it is load-bearing twice over.
- **A build only ever updates within its own channel.** The channels are separate bundle ids installed
  side by side; crossing would mean installing a different app. `com.hintheshell.rolo.dev` never updates
  at all, and does not advertise the command.
- **Nothing is installed unless every check passes.** Bundle id, version and signature are all checked
  on the expanded copy before `replaceItemAt` runs, and the running app survives any failure untouched.
- **Relaunching goes through `NSApp.terminate`, never `exit`.** That is what flushes a pending note
  draft and hands back the Hyper Key's HID-level caps remap, which outlives the process.
- **An automatic prompt defers to whatever the user is doing.** `UpdateReadiness` withholds it while a
  snippet is expanding, an extension command is running, an uninstall is trashing, a shortcut is being
  recorded, a prompt or dialog is up, or the palette is open. Readiness is asked again at the click.
- **Nothing about updates is persisted in `AppSettings`.** The feature owns one cache file, so no
  `AppSettingsKey` and no `SettingsBackupCoverage` entry exist for it.

## Channel and version

`ReleaseChannel` is derived from the bundle id, and nothing else:

| Bundle id | Channel | Takes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `com.hintheshell.rolo` | `.stable` | releases |
| `com.hintheshell.rolo.beta` | `.beta` | prereleases |
| anything else | `.development` | nothing |

`AppVersion` parses `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-beta.N` with semver precedence: a
prerelease sorts below the release it leads to, and `beta.10` above `beta.9`. Everything else parses
to nil, which is deliberate — the repo also publishes `v0.9.7-sequoia` for the macOS 15 cask, and
rejecting the tag is what keeps a beta install from drifting onto the Sequoia build. A release whose
tag disagrees with its `prerelease` flag is treated as mis-published and skipped.

## Checking

`UpdateCheckStore` copies `CurrencyRateStore`: a private `.ephemeral`, `urlCache = nil` session, a
self-rescheduling pump, and one atomic JSON file.

```text
~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/update-check.json
```

It holds `lastCheckedAt`, the newest release seen, and the version the user dismissed. Freshness is
measured from `lastCheckedAt`, so relaunching never re-asks GitHub; the interval is 24 h, dropping to
2 h after a failed attempt, and the first check waits 30 s so it never lands in the login rush. The
request carries a `User-Agent`, which the GitHub API rejects requests without.

**Later means skip.** It records the version, so that release stops asking; a newer one still asks.
Check for Updates ignores the record and always offers whatever is newer than what is running.

## Installing

One route, whatever the install came from:

1. Stream the zip into `~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/Updates/`, with real byte progress and a Cancel
   that actually aborts the transfer.
2. `ditto -x -k` it into a staging folder, and take whatever `.app` lands there — the bundle is named
   for its channel, so it is `Rolo Beta.app` on beta.
3. Check quarantine natively; clear it if somehow present, and refuse the update if it survives.
4. Verify the bundle id, the version, and that the code signature is valid and carries the same leaf
   certificate as the running app.
5. `FileManager.replaceItemAt`. The staging folder is on the same volume as `/Applications`, which is
   what lets this be atomic. A non-writable `/Applications` is reported, not worked around; there is
   no privileged helper.
6. Offer Relaunch, which spawns a detached waiter that reopens the app once this process exits —
   `open` on a bundle id that is still running would only re-activate the instance on its way out.

Nothing here touches `~/Library/Preferences`, `~/Library/Caches` or `Application Support`, so no
setting, clipboard entry, note or snippet is affected by an update, by `brew upgrade`, or by both.

## Releasing into it

`.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes two assets from one build: the DMG people download by hand
and the cask installs, and `Rolo-<version>.zip` for the updater. The zip is made with

```sh
ditto -c -k --keepParent --sequesterRsrc "$APP" "dist/$ZIP_FILE"
```

which is the only zip that leaves the code signature verifiable — plain `zip` drops symlinks and
breaks the seal, and the signature check above would then reject every update.

**The cask must declare `auto_updates true`** in `hintheshell/homebrew-rolo`. Without it Homebrew
compares its Caskroom receipt against the cask version, sees a self-updated app as outdated forever,
and re-installs over it on the next `brew upgrade`.
